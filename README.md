Income Prediction with Fairness & Bias Analysis
📌 Project Overview

This project aims to build a machine learning model that predicts whether an individual earns more than $50K per year (binary classification). Beyond achieving predictive accuracy, the project places strong emphasis on fairness and bias analysis, ensuring that model decisions remain equitable across protected attributes such as sex and race.

🎯 Objectives

Develop a predictive model for income classification.

Assess fairness in model predictions with respect to sensitive attributes.

Explore mitigation strategies to reduce bias while maintaining performance.

Provide insights and recommendations for responsible AI deployment.

🔑 Key Steps
1. Data Collection & Cleaning

Load dataset (UCI Adult / Census Income dataset).

Handle missing values and duplicates.

Standardize column names for consistency.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Analyze feature distributions and relationships with income.

Identify potential sources of bias in the dataset.

Visualize disparities across sex and race groups.

3. Data Preprocessing & Encoding

Encode categorical variables using appropriate techniques (One-Hot, Label Encoding).

Preserve protected attributes for fairness analysis.

Normalize/scale continuous features if needed.

4. Baseline Model Building

Train classification models:

Logistic Regression

Random Forest

Evaluate using standard metrics (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1, ROC-AUC).

5. Bias & Fairness Assessment

Measure fairness metrics:

Demographic Parity

Equal Opportunity

Disparate Impact

Compare model outcomes across sex and race.

6. Bias Mitigation Strategies

Apply techniques such as:

Reweighting / Resampling

Fairness-aware algorithms

Post-processing calibration

Reassess model performance & fairness trade-offs.

7. Insights & Recommendations

Summarize findings from fairness analysis.

Provide real-world implications for deploying equitable ML models.

Suggest strategies to ensure ongoing monitoring for bias.
